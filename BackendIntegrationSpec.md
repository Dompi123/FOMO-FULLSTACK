# Backend Integration Specification

## Payment Flow Integration

### Tokenization Endpoint
- **URL**: `/v1/payments/tokenize`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json

### Request Format
```json
{
  "card_number": "4111111111111111",
  "expiry_month": "12",
  "expiry_year": "25",
  "cvc": "123"
}
```

### Response Model
```swift
struct PaymentTokenResponse: Codable {
  let token: String
  let expiry: String
  let last4: String
}
```

### Error Responses
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_card",
    "message": "The card number provided is invalid"
  }
}
```

### Required Headers
- `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`
- `X-Client-Version: 1.0.0`
- `X-Device-ID: <unique_device_id>`

### Security Requirements
1. All requests must be made over HTTPS
2. API keys must be kept secure and not exposed in client code
3. Card numbers must be tokenized before storage
4. PCI compliance requirements must be met

### Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 429 Too Many Requests response when limit exceeded

### Implementation Notes
1. Card validation should be performed server-side
2. Tokens should expire after 24 hours
3. Failed attempts should be logged for security monitoring
4. Response times should be under 2 seconds

### Testing
- Test cards provided for different scenarios
- Sandbox environment available for integration testing
- Webhook support for asynchronous notifications

### Error Codes
- `invalid_card`: Card number validation failed
- `expired_card`: Card has expired
- `insufficient_funds`: Not enough available credit
- `processing_error`: General processing error
- `rate_limit_exceeded`: Too many requests

### Monitoring
- Real-time dashboard for transaction monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Response time metrics
- Success/failure ratio monitoring
